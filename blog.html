					<h1 >Impact of  Techonology</h1>
					<div class="circle1"></div>
					
					<p>Technology is the use of scientific knowledge for practical purposes or applications, whether in industry or in our everyday lives. So, basically, whenever we use our scientific knowledge to achieve some specific purpose, we're using technology. Well, there is slightly more to it than that. Technology usually involves a specific piece of equipment, but that equipment can be incredibly simple or dazzlingly complex. It can be anything from the discovery of the wheel, all the way up to computers.The Internet is the Information Age's decisive technology, and with the explosion of wireless communication in the early twenty-first century, we can say that humanity is now almost entirely connected, albeit with great levels of bandwidth, efficiency and price inequality.  <br>
					The early years of the 21st century saw an explosion in Internet usage. The popularity of this global interconnected network system continues to grow continuously from the day it appeared in human life. Obviously, with universal access to information and an interactive communication mechanism that the Internet offers, it is not difficult to understand why people around the world are addicted to it. E-Commerce, E-Business and E-Marketing are phenomena that appear as a result of the invasion of the Internet. There is no doubt about the benefits of using the Internet in daily life.</p><br>
						
					<h1>Positive Impact</h1> 
					<div class="circle2"></div>
					

					<p>The internet is the guiding technology of the IT Age just as the electrical engine was of the Industrial Age. It is one of the greatest invention of man-kind that can has connected almost every human in this planet. Every bit of information is available in the web. Itâ€™s been postulated that about 95% of all information available has been digitized and made accessible via the internet. As a student technology has highly affected by life and the most most widely used technology by me is the internet. Internet has brought effective means of communication to any part of the world. Education has received a tremendous boost as countless books and journals are available online from libraries worldwide, that has facilitated research. Students can now opt to use internet for online courses. In this techonolical era the first mean if research in a student's life is th internet. It has become a paltform of knowledge and conformation. <br>
					As being an IT student internet is the only book I carry to college and through which teaching is done. As a student of Islington college we are globally connected to every teachers ands student throught our college email and google classroom. Google class room is the main platfrom of study and reference for a student in Islington. Including study internet technology is also used for business interactions and transactions.You can access the latest news from any part of the world without depending on the TV or newspaper. <br> 
					The internet is a facility for anyone in the field of education. Especially for students and teachers, to always update information about education, the internet is very important to the learning process. And keep in mind, it's wise to operate the internet so we can have positive impacts, because we will find many benefits on the internet. It is therefore very important to learn how to use the internet wisely to get benefits.

					</p><br>
					<h1>Negative Impact</h1>	
					<div class="circle3"></div>
					<p>	
					There is growing concern developing along with the growth of this global system. It's about the negative effects of the Internet. The lack of control over information sources, security leaks or Internet addiction is more commonly reported than ever before.  Never in the past have the negative effects of the Internet received as much attention as this century. <br>
					With easy availability of every information in the web, there is also availability to all sorts of illegal and inappropiate substance and videos like drugs, porn, weapons, etc. In this generation what we can witness is with access to easy communication through the internet the people in this generation has nearly stoped communcating face to face. Its safe to say that social media has made us anti-social. The internet has become a paltform to share hatred and act of terrorism. Now and there are some sorts of terrorist videos poppping all over the web which has brought a question of Is Internet Safe?. <br>
					Also there is risk of stealing of private information. Messages of scams and phisings offen come which has led to some people losing lots of money and information. Also there are hackers, identity theives, internet predetors, cyber bulling, viruses, malware, etc. that has made internet a dangerous place for the unknowns.</p><br>
						
						
					<h1>Verdict</h1>
					<p>I believe with every pro there is con, so the question of Is Internet technology Good or Bad? always remain in the society. I think of technology as an ally, sure there are dangers of the technology but such dangers arise due to lack of awareness and misuse of such technology. Every other thing that we use comes with a guideline and to get maximum benifit and be safe from it's dangers we must always be inside those guide lines. Therefore, we must always be aware of tha dangers of the technology we use. Thus, technology to man with good intentions and good practice is one of the greatest tool in this era.
